# qbzd

**Qobuz Connect receiver for Linux — headless, containerized.**

qbzd is a lightweight daemon that makes any Linux machine (or container) appear as a Qobuz Connect device. Once running, it shows up in the Qobuz app (Android, iOS, macOS, web) and accepts playback commands from there.

Fork of [vicrodh/qbz](https://github.com/vicrodh/qbz) (MIT), stripped down to the headless daemon and its dependencies.

> **Legal:** This project uses the Qobuz API but is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or certified by Qobuz. Qobuz is a registered trademark of Qobuz SAS.

## Quick start (Docker)

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name qbzd \
  -p 8182:8182 \
  -v qbzd-data:/var/lib/qbzd \
  ghcr.io/qbarlas/qbzd:latest
```

Then authenticate:

```bash
docker exec -it qbzd qbzd login
```

This opens the Qobuz OAuth URL. Open it in any browser on the same network. After login the device appears in the Qobuz app within a few seconds.

If the browser redirect cannot reach the container (e.g. Docker Desktop on macOS), pass the public address explicitly:

```bash
docker exec -it qbzd qbzd login --callback-host http://<your-host-ip>:8182
```

Alternatively, authenticate with a direct token (obtained from a Qobuz session cookie or a trusted tool):

```bash
docker exec -it qbzd qbzd login --token <user_auth_token>
```

---

## Configuration

Mount a `qbzd.toml` into `/etc/qbz/qbzd.toml` to override defaults:

```toml
[server]
port = 8182

[audio]
backend = "pipewire"   # pipewire | alsa | pulse

[qconnect]
enabled     = true
device_name = "Living Room"   # name shown in Qobuz app

```

A default config is baked into the image at `/etc/qbz/qbzd.toml.default`.

### ProxMox / audio passthrough

For real audio output, pass through the ALSA device or PipeWire socket from the host:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
devices:
  - /dev/snd:/dev/snd
environment:
  - ALSA_CARD=0
```

Or for PipeWire:

```yaml
volumes:
  - /run/user/1000/pipewire-0:/run/user/1000/pipewire-0
```

## HTTP API

The daemon exposes a local REST API on port 8182.

| Group | Endpoints |
|-------|-----------|
| Auth | `POST /api/auth/oauth/start` · `GET /api/auth/oauth/callback` · `GET /api/auth/oauth/status` · `POST /api/auth/token` |
| System | `GET /api/ping` · `GET /api/status` · `GET /api/info` · `GET /api/events` (SSE) · `GET /api/system/resources` · `DELETE /api/cache` |
| Playback | `GET /api/playback` · play · pause · stop · next · previous · seek · volume |
| Queue | `GET /api/queue` · set · add · add-next · play-index · remove · move · clear · shuffle · repeat |
| Audio | `GET/PATCH /api/audio/settings` · backends · devices · hardware-status |

## Credits

qbzd is a fork of [vicrodh/qbz](https://github.com/vicrodh/qbz) by
[blitzkriegfc](https://github.com/vicrodh), the original author of the Qobuz
Connect receiver. The core architecture, audio backends, Qobuz API client, and
QConnect protocol implementation all originate from that project.

This fork strips the desktop UI and refocuses the project as a headless daemon.
