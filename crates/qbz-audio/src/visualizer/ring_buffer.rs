//! Lock-free Ring Buffer for Audio Sample Capture
//!
//! This implementation is designed to be called from the audio thread without
//! any blocking operations. The audio thread is the only writer, and the
//! visualizer thread is the only reader.
//!
//! CRITICAL: This must not affect bit-perfect playback in any way.
//! - No locks or mutexes
//! - No allocations
//! - Minimal atomic operations
