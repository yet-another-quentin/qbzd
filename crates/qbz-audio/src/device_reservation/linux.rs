//! Linux implementation of `DeviceReservation`.
//!
//! Implements a client of the `org.freedesktop.ReserveDevice1` D-Bus protocol
//! (specified by the PulseAudio project, also implemented by PipeWire,
//! WirePlumber, JACK, MPD, Roon Bridge, etc.). For an ALSA device string of
//! the form `hw:N,M` (or `plughw:`, or `hw:CARD=Name`), we map the *card*
//! index `N` to the well-known bus name `org.freedesktop.ReserveDevice1.AudioN`
//! and request ownership of it.
//!
//! Acquisition algorithm (matches the spec at
//! `qbz-nix-docs/specs/2026-05-07-alsa-exclusive-hardening-design.md`):
//!
//! 1. `RequestName` with `DO_NOT_QUEUE`.
//! 2. `PrimaryOwner` / `AlreadyOwner` -> we own it. Done.
//! 3. `Exists` / `InQueue` -> someone else holds it. Read their `Priority`
//!    property; if our priority is higher, call `RequestRelease(our_priority)`
//!    on the holder. If that returns `true`, retry `RequestName` with
//!    `DO_NOT_QUEUE | REPLACE_EXISTING`.
//! 4. Anything else (zbus error, refusal, equal-or-lower priority) -> err.
//!
//! On `Drop`, an active guard releases the bus name. A *degraded* guard
//! (returned when the session bus is unavailable) is a no-op on `Drop`.
